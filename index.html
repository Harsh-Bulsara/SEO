        <p>A Simple HTML & CSS Website typically consists of three core pages: a homepage, an about page, and a contact page. 
            These pages form the foundation of most basic websites, offering essential information about the site’s purpose, its owner or business, and ways for visitors to connect.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Homepage – The First Impression</h3>
        <p>
            The homepage serves as the entry point of the website, creating the first impression for visitors. 
            It should be well-designed with an intuitive layout, clear navigation, and engaging content. 
            A Simple HTML & CSS Website ensures a lightweight and responsive design, making it accessible across various devices.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The homepage often includes a hero section featuring a welcoming message, a brief introduction, and a call-to-action (CTA) to encourage visitors to explore further. 
            Additional elements may include featured services, a summary of the business or individual’s expertise, and quick links to the About and Contact pages. 
            Using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, the homepage can have a visually appealing layout while maintaining fast load times and ease of use.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>About Page – The Story Behind the Website</h3>
        <p>
            The About page is crucial in providing visitors with background information about the individual, business, or organization behind the website. It helps build trust and credibility by offering insights into the website’s purpose, mission, and values.
            <br>
            A Simple HTML & CSS Website typically structures the About page with headings, paragraphs, and possibly a section featuring images or team members. This page often includes:
            <div>
                <li>A brief history or introduction</li>
                <li>The mission or vision statement</li>
                <li>An overview of services or expertise</li>
                <li>Testimonials or success stories (if applicable)</li>
            </div>
        </p>
    </section>
